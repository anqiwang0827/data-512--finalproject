Currently, the differences in employment distribution and earnigns of women and men within occupation is still a concern. And this projects seeks to explore occupational differences between sexes and the cause using the data from Bureau of Labor Statistics for all working American citizens. And we found that there are still many jobs that are dominated by men with more than 80% expecially for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields. And in general, higher paid occupations have bigger gender gaps, such as securities, commodities and financial service agents. Therefore, this projec aims to supports the need of policy change for US policymakers in wage discriminate prevention. In order to close the wage gap, we also need attention from employers and publics besides the policymakers.
